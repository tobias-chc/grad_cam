# Grad CAM

This is a small project to visualize class activation maps for debugging deep neural networks using an algorithm called Grad-CAM.

Using Grad-CAM, we can visually validate where our network is looking, verifying that it is indeed looking 
at the correct patterns in the image and activating around those patterns.
